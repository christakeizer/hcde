            I'm a second-year HCDE master's student with zero dev or engineering experience. My background is in marketing communications and I'm hoping to learn some technical skills that I can apply to user research. I am hoping I can help others with design or html skills and I hope I can become more confident and comfortable around hardware in the class.
