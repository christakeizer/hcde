	<h2> Process </h2>
		<h4> I started off by revolving a peg-like shape around a circle in Illustrator to form a gear shape. I moved it to Onshape to test it out. I made final changes in Illustrator before printing with a laser printer. My first print had enormous holes because I had mistakenly made the holes bigger in Onshape after it wouldn't let me use the fastener in the way I wanted. My second print did not quite work the way I wanted because the gears weren't close enough:

	<h4> I redesigned the background piece to move the gears closer together. Alas, the gears still weren't quite working:</h4>

		    <br><b>Lessons Learned:</b>
		    <ul>
			    <li>Measure holes ahead of time. I had measured the holes correctly initially and then had a hard time fitting them in Onshape, so I made them bigger. Then I printed on acrylic the first time (dumb) and the holes were way too big.</li>
			    <li>Illustrator is better for spacing out holes correctly.</li>
			    <li>Make gear pegs fatter so they'll work correctly.</li>
	</ul>
