                <body> <b> Step 1:</b> I started out by cutting my teeth on Rhino and Grasshopper... I had no idea what I was doing.

                    <b>Step 2:</b> When I was able to make an polygon. (took me forever to find the polygon took) I started making an array around my shape. (I later realized I needed 8 sides not 6.)

                    <b>Step 3:</b> I needed to rotate my octogon by pi/8, but I was trying to do it with 360(degrees) divided by 8. Tyson corrected me.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>Step 4:</b> Finally I figured out how to get the shape I wanted. I adjusted the slots using Grasshopper and saved out two different versions of my shape, one with a "Chewy box" size, and another with an "Imperfect Produce box" size. By that point I was a bit too flustered with Rhino/Grasshopper, so I took the shape into Illustrator to duplicate it and prepare it for printing.
         
                    <b>Step 5:</b> I printed using 100 power and frequency; 25 speed. The Chewy cardboard was quite thick so anything higher than 25 speed did not print correctly. I also had to re-do my Chewy slots once using Grasshopper.
