            Here is all the documentation for assignment 2!<br>
                <a href="cardboard.ai">Ai source file</a>
                <body> <b> Step 1:</b> I started out by cutting post-it notes and slotting them together. This is how I decided that I would use octagons. 
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 2:</b>When I was able to make a ball-like structure, I got started in Illustrator. I measured the cardboard to understand how big my slots should be.
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 3:</b>I went to the MILL to "print" my cardboard. I used a standard Amazon box and cut it into a rectangle. Then I made my Illustrator file the same size as the piece of cardboard. I did this twice to print two "pages" of cut-outs.
